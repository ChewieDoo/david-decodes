My profile coded in React Framework with Tailwind CSS.

The code is destructured so that if any changes need to be made, I just need to edit the JS object that I have created inside `Context.jsx`. The React components uses the data context to then render specific parts of the webpage.

I try to keep the jsx components below 100 lines when possible and destructure as much as I can to make it easy to read and understand.

Added things ontoo my new laptop so just testing if things still work.

### Notes

Tasks:

- COMPLETED Create navigatable table of contents
- Add in a let's talk option at the bottom (email and linkedin?)
- COMPLETED Figure out responsive CSS (when in mobile or smaller display size, wrap the social icons around)
- COMPLETED Route up the links
- COMPLETED Organize code into React framework (data context, Tailwind components, etc.)
- COMPLETED Develop Zara page (build out prototype, create skeleton HTML, styling, destructure)
- COMPLETED Develop Depop page -> change layout
- COMPLETED Deploy website
- COMPLETED Compress / resize image to decrease loading time

Depop Page:

- COMPLETED Change gif files to only show mock up frames
- COMPLETED Make the webpage responsive
- COMPLETED Deploy

Zara Page:

1. REMOVED Add in an image loader
2. COMPLETED Build out basic HTML skeleton for 2 sections
3. COMPLETED Style it -> create common Tailwind components that can be applied to other sections
4. COMPLETE Make case study responsive
   _NOTE_ When in large display, things a bit funky... the content is not centered
5. COMPLETED Add fancy stuff (back-button, navigation, catalog on right hand side <-consider how to destucture this)
6. Add in image loading function so website loads in time
7. COMPLETED Destructure - CSS, JSX
8. COMPLETED Deploy

Daily Plan:

- DONE One of the image is jutting out in Zara Page
- (Priority next time) Issue with loading larger image (i.e. Wireframe onto webpage when deployed, need to consider alternative methd of uploading images)
- DONE Organize code and remove redundancies
